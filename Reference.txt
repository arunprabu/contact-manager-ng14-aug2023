Webapps 
-----
  1. SSR (Server Side Rendering Apps)
      * pages will refresh
      * traditional apps

  2. CSR (Client Side Rendering Apps)
      * pages will not refresh 
      * SPA (front end app) + REST API (back end app)
      * modern apps

SPA (Single Page Apps)
----------------------
  7 Characteristics
  ==================
    1. Pages should not reload / refresh [DONE]
    2. URL should change [DONE]
    3. History should be maintained w/o page refresh [DONE]
    4. Header and footer should not be loaded again and again [DONE]
    5. The section in b/w header and footer should show contextual updates [DONE]
    6. Active menu should be set [TODO]

Project Structure
----------------
  1. Building-Block-wise structure

          components/
          directives/
          services/

          guards/

  2. Feature-wise structure

        app/
          shared/
            components/
            services/

          contact/
            components/
            directives/
            guards/

Components
----------


Naming Conventions & Casing Conventions 
----
Casing Types 
  --------
    1. PascalCase 
        * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
        * also Recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 

        examples 
        ---
          class CarDetails {

          }

          interface Employee {

          }

    2. camelCase 
        * Recommended for variables, let, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
        * Recommended for id's of html 

        examples 
        -----
          var myCar = 'BMW';

          function getCarInfo() {
            //....
          }

          <div id="myContainer"></div>
    
    3. kebab-case
        * Recommended for URLs 
        * Recommended for file names, folder names (if not react), assets in front end projects 
        * Recommended for css classes 
        * okay for id's of html elements if your architect says okay

        examples 
        -----
          btn-primary
          slideshow-container 
          youtube-logo.png 

    4. snake_case
        * never ever use this. 
        * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

        examples
        ---
          const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;

Routing
=======
  Step 0:
  -------
    identifying the URLs 

    Home
      http://localhost:61550/
    
    Concepts 
      http://localhost:61550/concepts

    Contact Manager App 
      http://localhost:61550/contact-manager

    About 
      http://localhost:61550/about

    
  Step 1: 
  ----
    Let's setup the above URLs in menu list comp
    Let's check the app. URL will NOT be stable.

  Step 2: 
  -----
    Let's create the matching components for the URLs 

    ng g c home/components/home -t -s 
    ng g c concepts/components/concepts -s 
    ng g c contact-manager/components/contact-list -s 
    ng g c about/components/about -s -t 
  
  Step 3: 
  -----
    Let's config the routes in app-routing.module.ts 

    Let's check the app. URL will be stable. 
    But, the component is not loaded in between header and footer.
    Pages are getting refreshed. 

  Step 4:
  -----
    The components are not loaded when the hit the URLs 
    So, Let's fix this in the layout file. 
    In between the header and footer, setup <router-outlet></router-outlet> in app.comp.html 

  Step 5: 
  ----
    Let's fix the page refresh problem.
    replace href with routerLink in menu-list.comp.html 

  Step 6:
  -----
    Check the app. It's over!


Eslint Setup & Prettier Setup
=============================

Clean Coding Principle 
======================

Data Binding 
-----
  keeping the data in comp.ts and displaying in comp.html 

  1. Interpolation 
      TS ==> HTML 
      {{}}

  2. Property Binding
      TS ==> HTML 
      []

  3. Event Binding 
      TS <=== HTML 
      ()

  4. Two Way Binding
      TS <==> HTML 
      [(ngModel)]

      Note: try in form elements like input, textarea, select, 

  5. Custom Property Binding
  6. Custom Event Binding


Cross Component Communication
============================
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication 
      using Custom Property Binding (DONE)

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication
      2.1 using Custom Event Binding  (TO LEARN)
      2.2 using @ViewChild() or @ViewChildren()  (TODO)

  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      3.1 Using Services, RxJS/Observables, Subcription (TO LEARN)
      3.2 Using NgRx (third party tool)  (TO LEARN)
